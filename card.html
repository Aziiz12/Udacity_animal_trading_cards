			<p class="fact">Sight is the strongest of all eagle senses. The eyes are large, can take up almost 50% of the head, and can weigh the same amount as a human eye. An eagles vision is 4–5 times better than that of a human. Eagle eyes are angled 30 degrees away from centre of the face, which gives eagles a greater field of view. Eagles can see five basic colours to our three, and can detect UV light.

			<p class="description">Like all birds of prey,
				 eagles have very large, hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong,
				  muscular legs, and powerful talons.
				   The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey.</p>
